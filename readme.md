# Lucidity TokenList

Token Lists is a specification for lists of token metadata (e.g. address, decimals, etc.) that can be used by any dApp interfaces that needs one or more lists of tokens.
Currently we only have list of tokens in ETH Mainnet. Later we will update to support tokens from other chains.

## Specification
```
{
    "decimals": 18, 
    "logo": "https://static.alchemyapi.io/images/assets/2396.png",
    "name": "WETH", 
    "symbol": "WETH", 
    "address": "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2"
}
```
